title: Things learnt as a Senior

So I told you about being a part of Debating Society of IIT Kharagpur. Being a second year, I got the opportunity of taking fresher's selections this year. 

Upon interacting with them, I realized that I have grown up in the past one year since I could feel they were so innocent and less informed. I felt that knowingly or unknowlingly, I have grown up through the experiences I had in my first year. That gave me some satisfaction and a feeling of responsiblity.
