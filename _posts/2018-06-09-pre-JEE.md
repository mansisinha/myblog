I would begin with talking about my life before JEE.

When I was a kid, I used to dream about becoming an "Engineer" when I grow up. But I never really realised the amount of effort it would take. I was lucky enough to get all my needs fulfilled by my parents and hence, I thought life was a bed of roses. 

 So like most of us, I started preparing for JEE in 11th standard but I used to attend school and enjoy there too. School was the place to relax and hangout with friends. I had an amazing school life since I had the most notorious bunch of friends.

Then JEE 2016 happened.

Even though I secured a rank in JEE Advance 2016, I realised that this was not what I aimed for. I was disappointed. I felt like a failure.

And now when I look at it, I realise that that was the failure that I needed. That made me serious towards studies and made me realise the intensity of the competition. I decided to give it another shot and this time, I did study hard. So as expected, I passed this time with a good rank and joined the course of Mathematics and Computing at IIT Kharagpur.
