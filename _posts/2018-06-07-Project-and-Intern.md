In my 3rd semester, I started learning machine learning with the help of Machine learning course by Dr. Andrew Ng, Standford University on coursera. That sparked my interest in this field and hence to explore more of this field I took up a project in the department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kharagpur.

In that project, I am working on natural language processing. The aim of the project is to derive derivational nouns in English, using a graph based semi-supervised approach.
