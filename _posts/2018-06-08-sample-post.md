Like any other teenager, I was very excited on joining the college.

I spent my first year exploring the beautiful campus, the vast range of opportunities, meeting new people, making new friends, joining different types of societies, meeting some really inspiring people.

One of the initial difficulties I had in college was to cycle to the classes in such a huge campus. That too in such hot and humid environment. But slowly, I became used to it and now, I've explored almost the entire campus.

Then I joined a few societies like Debating Society, Business Club, KOSS and IR cell. I met a few amazing Seniors through these societies. Here at Kgp, Seniors help their juniors in every way they can.

Currently, I'm a part of KOSS and DebSoc.

KOSS is the place where I got to learn a lot about open source. It is the open source society of IIT Kgp. There are a bunch of people like me who are enthusiastic about open source, coding etc. It's a great medium to learn and grow with alike people.

DebSoc, on the other hand is about debating, having a firm opinion about issues that matter. It helped me improve as a speaker and increased my knowledge regarding the current issues.


So overall, first year was an amazing learning experience. I learnt a lot of things that can't be found in books.
