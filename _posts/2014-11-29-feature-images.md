After the tiring end-semester exams, I decided to take a break and relax.This was much needed after a very fast first year.

I came back home during the vacations and spent the first week chilling and taking up old hobbies like drawing, singing and performing yoga in the morning. Singing is something very close to me since I learnt Indian Classical Music when I was a kid. Drawing is something I used to do in school but had to give up during JEE since I could not get enough time and I needed to focus on my studies. Yoga is something which keeps me calm. I used to perform Yoga every morning during JEE preparation. It helps me focus and releases stress.

After I've had my share of break, I started learning Python. I took the help of a book called "learn python the hard way" and practiced questions on codeacademy. I still don't think I know enough of Python as I'm still learning. The logical part was easy to understand because of my previous knowledge of Java and C. But the file handling part is something new and challenging for me.

I am a member of KOSS at IIT Kharagpur. We were given a task to create our own blog on Jekyll. So after spending a few days on Python, I started working on this blog. The most challenging part was installing Jekyll on Windows. Once it was installed successfully, the creation of website was really interesting.

Amidst this work, I took a break and went on a family vacation to Sikkim. Sikkim is such a beautiful place. I visited Gangtok, East Sikkim and some parts of North Sikkim. It was an amazing experience.


Now coming back to work, I've started learning C++ STL with the help of topcoder but that is just on the beginners stage.
