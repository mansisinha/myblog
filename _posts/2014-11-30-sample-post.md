I would begin with talking about my life before JEE.
So like most of us, I was preparing for JEE since 11th standard but I used to attend school and enjoy there too. School was the place to relax and hangout with friends. I had an amazing school life since I had the most notorious bunch of friends.
Then JEE 2016 happened.
Even though I secured a rank in JEE Advance 2016, I realised that this was not what I aimed for. I was disappointed. I felt like a failure.
And now when I look at it, I realise that that was the failure that I needed. That made me serious towards studies and made me realise the intensity of the competition. I decided to give it another shot and this time, I did study hard. So as expected, I passed this time with a good rank and joined the course of Mathematics and Computing at IIT Kharagpur.
Like any other teenager, I was very excited on joining the college.
I spent my first year exploring the campus, the vast range of opportunities, the different types of societies, the inspiring people.
First year was more of a fresh learning experience. Learning things that can not be found in books.
